## Project Background

Provision of project management and engineering for a Tokyo data center, upgrading APC Symmetra to the latest Symmetra LX.

Additionally, we took advantage of the opportunity to be allowed by the busy legal professionals to have a full 40-hour time window, to bolster the data center's earthquake proofing, and to remove old equipment and cable, as well as to re-vamp the structured cabling in the racks to gain more space for growth.

This project long to plan, and a challenge to execute, given the many teams involved - project, construction, electricity, cabling and test.

## Benefits
