## What is Project Management?

Project management is the art of closely coupling tasks with actions, managing budget and schedule quality to ensure there are no problems with overages or slippages, and, ensuring that clients are getting their expected return on investment regarding the project’s agreed deliverables.

<div class="esolia-card-panel purple darken-4 z-depth-1">
  <h4 class="center green-text text-accent-3">Why PM?</h4>
    <ol>
      <li class="white-text">Enables controlled, step-by-step progress</li>
      <li class="white-text">Control of requirement delivery</li>
      <li class="white-text">Reduction of politics and bias</li>
      <li class="white-text">Emphasis on transparency</li>
      <li class="white-text">Protect investment</li>
    </ol>
</div>

All this happens, while the PM maintains the required administrative project structures, plans, and operational momentum.

### Our PM Approach

Our practical project management approach is unique, and it allows us to avoid typical project issues like the "parkinson's effect" where work mysteriously expands to fill available time, ill-managed schedules and scopes, over analysis and other pitfalls.

Our professionals work with your functional and technical experts, in English or Japanese, and if you will advise us your constraints including deadlines, any "sacred cows", budget and mandates, we will work flexibly toward your goal keeping those in mind.

We have our own hybrid project management methodology, but are flexible in our approach. Our high level project activities are as follows:

1. Initiation
1. Controlled Implementation
1. Closure
1. Maintenance

Our goal is to get your project done; not necessarily to have a certificate that says we might.
