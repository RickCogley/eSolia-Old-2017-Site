### Dispatch engineers

With a master agreement, on-demand, part-time or full-time on-site coverage is available. We can dispatch engineers including the following:

* User Support Professionals
* Desktop and Laptop Engineers
* Server Engineers
* Network Engineers
* Database Administrators
* Website Developers
* Application Developers

In all cases, we strive to provide support which supports the continuity of your business, assigning at least 2 professionals to your account, and providing an "agnostic" service based on industry best practices, not locked to any one vendors's platform or service.
