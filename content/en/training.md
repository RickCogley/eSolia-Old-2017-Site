eSolia delivers training to help our clients maximize their technology investment, increase productivity, reduce support costs and motivate employees.

Although most training courses comprise similar basic elements, not all training is the same. eSolia's training is designed to meet the specific needs of each customer, and is delivered in a flexible manner by experienced trainers and technical professionals.

### eSolia Training Types

eSolia provides the following types of training:

* _New hire orientation_ training for company employees
* _Productivity software_ training for office workers
* _Technical topic_ training for developers and system administrators
* _Localized_ training for your corporate application
* _Ad hoc_ training during projects, for a specific purpose

... in the following sort of training scenarios:  

* Conference room training at your site using your computing environment
* One-to-one consultative training, in person or via remote access
* Training at off-site locations

#### Housekeeping: Preparation & Cancellation

Training requires preparation, which can be performed under your existing master contract, or as a separate project. For fully custom training, preparation can be quite extensive (indeed, it is a project in itself), but for pre-existing training, preparation is relatively quick.

eSolia has a specific cancellation policy for scheduled classes, the gist of which is, the closer to the time of the class, the more is owed in the case of a cancellation.

In both cases, the details will be made clear when discussing the project.

### Success Stories

eSolia has been successfully delivering training to our clients since 1999. Here's a sampling of the courses we've delivered, since starting:
