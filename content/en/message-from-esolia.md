Thank you for visiting, and for your support and business. When we founded eSolia in 1999, our goal was simply to develop a stable, well-rounded group of engineers to provide high-quality IT services to foreign multinationals in Japan. We've accomplished that, and stayed true to our initial mission, but are now serving Japanese organizations as well.

We've been continuously and tenaciously refining our concept, services, practices and systems, so that we are able to provide clear information about client systems, work and project status, and any risks or problems we discover. We have been fortunate to have a successful track record managing high-pressure projects and consulting engagements - ones like Japan Market Entry, ERP rollouts, IT merges related to time-sensitive M&A's, technology refreshes, or, process re-engineering linked to a revenue target or operational metric.

We want to foster and grow long-term relationships with our clients, and help them over time develop the practices, standards and policies that will act as the roots to support and serve their businesses. Let us show you how eSolia can help you meet your business commitments. We are at your service.

Sincerely,  
**_eSolia Inc._**
