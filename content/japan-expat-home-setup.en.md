* Regular maintenance for existing systems, typically including hard disk defragmentation, cache clearing, general cleanup, with recommendations.
* Basic 15-minute "system walkthrough" training.
* Consultation session to address your specific questions about how to proceed.

### How Long Does it Take?

A full setup for a new system typically takes 3 or 4 hours, but it depends upon what you require and what options you would like us to implement. We can give a time and cost estimate once we define the scope of work with you.

Here are some of the factors that impact the time and cost required:

* We are based in Tokyo, so there is cost associated with requesting us to travel to areas outside the Greater Tokyo area.
* Multiple visits naturally cost more than a single visit.
* Have your software installers, license numbers and any needed passwords ready, so that the work may proceed smoothly.
* For downloadable software, it is more time-efficient to have already downloaded the installer files, especially in the case of a large file like MS Office.
* Older or failing systems, as well as un-maintained systems (e.g with full hard disks) may be slow.
* Adding tasks to the work order during the work, will cause delays.
