## IP PBX Call Recording

Whatever the size of your organization - from a small professional corporation to a large enterprise - you chose to deploy a VoIP communications system for the capital and operational cost savings and the productivity advantages for your users.

Now you are looking to add a call recording option to your system to either address legal mandates or increase operational effectiveness.

But what you find are simplistic PC-based handset tools or expensive choices that require complex integration, significant maintenance and specialized IT support. Until now ...

### Enter PROcr

**PROcr** call recording is just like your phone system: _easy to install, easy to operate and easy to afford_.

    <ol>
      <li class="white-text">Call Centers</li>
      <li class="white-text">Financial Services</li>

    </ol>

Three versions are available, allowing for efficient scalability.

1. "Express" for SOHOs with up to 15 seats
1. "Small Business Edition" for companies with up to 70 seats
1. "Enterprise Edition" for larger companies

All offer enterprise-class call recording performance for training, Q/A, compliance or regulatory purposes at the corporate, branch or small office level.

PROcr is powered by the well-regarded **SIP Print** engine.
